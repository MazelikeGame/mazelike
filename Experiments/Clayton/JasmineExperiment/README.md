# Jasmine Experiment
## Resources
I researched the [Jasmine documentation](https://jasmine.github.io/index.html). A pretty good tutorial
can be found on the [Jasmine website](https://jasmine.github.io/2.1/introduction).

The goal was to learn the basics and syntax of Jasmine.

## How To
```
jasmine spec/PlayerSpec.js
```

Jasmine should then run the tests.

# Pixi Experiment
## Resources
I researched the [PixiJS documentation](http://pixijs.download/dev/docs/index.html) and [examples](https://pixijs.io/examples/#/basics/basic.js). I also found a nice long tutorial about PixiJS located on [GitHub](https://github.com/kittykatattack/learningPixi)

The goal was to learn the basics of PixiJS and ES6 JavaScript classes.

## Features
1. Player movement using the keyboard (Can be improved by smoothing the movement)
2. Tile images for texturing
3. Random map generation (Can be improved by generating an 2D array for terrain types. Similar to ComS 327)

## How To
```
npm install
```

```
npm start
```
The application should now start on localhost:3000

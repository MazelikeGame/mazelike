- MUST RUN 'npm install mysql' for any sql related commands
- note that these ARE NOT tested, as idk our database info yet
  (and my one for cs363 is being weird)

- also realized part way through the course that its teaching more so teaching sql,
  and that basically any SQL is used with the generic node code that deals with databases
  (see select_ex.js)
